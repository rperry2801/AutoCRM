# AutoCRM
Free time project to make a car sales CRM application.

Currently this is a back up for version 0.0.0.2, where the entire front-end of the app is hard coded with Swing. After installing Eclipse WindowBuilder, I am going to re-create the app with a nicer front-end, but the database and all back-end development will function the same.

Not sure if I want 0.0.0.3 to stay this way so I am backing up what I currently have written in java to this repository.
